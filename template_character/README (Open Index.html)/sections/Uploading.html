			<p>
				Ok, now is a good time to double check you have everything in order.
			</p>
			<p>
				Then we need to create a thumbnail for the workshop <b class="important">THIS DOES NOT GO IN THE MOD
					FOLDER</b> it is only used
				by the workshop
				and uploading it would just take up space.
			</p>
			<p>
				the thumbnail (which is what you see when scrolling past) is a 268x268 image; however, you can probably
				just do like 512x512 and let steam scale it down for you.
			</p>
			<p>
				The big image you get when you click onto the actual mod page is basically just a 16:9 ratio image, I
				would suggest at least a 1920x1080 image.
			</p>
			<p>
				How you do this is up to you, but I have included some suggestions / helpful tips if you have done
				thumbnails before.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					For the thumbnail image you should aim to show off the main part of your mod (in which case the
					character), without making it too busy.
					for example, a druid type character against a forest will be very poor, as literally everything is
					green.
					instead for a druid do something like a zoom in of him sitting on a log, with the camera angle
					towards
					the sky to give good contrast.
				</li>
				<li>
					now for the big image you want to show off what your mod is all about, so maybe load up the game
					with
					your character and take multiple pictures
					from the main menu, to your character in action. you can add multiple of these types of images to
					your
					mod, so don't be afraid
					you can also add things like videos if you have something on youtube uploaded.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Once you have at least a thumbnail finished go the tools folder in Isaac and open the ModUploader tool
				once again. Select your mods <code>metadata.xml</code> only this time well be doing the things we didn't
				bother with
				last time
			</p>
			<p>
				so...
				for change notes I highly recommend for your 1.0 release you simply put "Initial Commmit" or something
				like that,
				then click the change button and find your thumbnail image (Not the big ones, you do that on the
				workshop page)
				finally if you didn't already set your tags.
			</p>
			<p>
				if you want you can set the intial visibility to "Private" which means no one will see it.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b class="important">IMPORTANT</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				Make sure to remove this guide folder from your mod before uploading (it still works in other folders,
				so just move the entire README folder somewhere else)
			</p>
			<p>
				Push Upload Mod.
			</p>
			<p>
				Once it finishes close the tool (Don't bother with the view mod button, it opens in a browser which is
				very not useful)
				then open Steam, find Isaac and click "Workshop"
				go under the "Browse" section and click "Subscribed Items"
				at the top of that page you can change it to "By YOUR STEAM NAME" ex. "by manaphoenix"
				click that and it will reload the page, and you can now see your mod that you uploaded.
				click that and lets setup the rest of the things.
